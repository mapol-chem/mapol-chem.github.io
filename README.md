### Overview

Light when nanoconfined in cavities and made to interact strongly with molecules results in hybrid light–matter states or polaritons, which can be used to modify and manipulate ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces and thus alter the reactivity and energy flow profoundly in molecular systems.The development of predictive theories for molecular polaritons requires combining electronic degrees of freedom, as provided by quantum chemistry methods, with quantum electrodynamics (QED) treatments of the photonic degrees of freedom.

Our vision is to develop a suite of theoretical frameworks, spanning low-order to high-level many-body  methods, that will provide unprecedented ability to capture the structure and dynamics of molecular polaritonic systems and deliver scalable software source code and libraries that can harness leadership-class computational facilities (LCFs). In pursuit of this vision, we have three project objectives to guide our research program. 

- **Objective 1:** Develop a Gaussian basis set–based suite of methods  spanning low-order to high-level ab initio many-body approaches for modeling and simulation of molecular  polaritonic systems.  
- **Objective 2:** Implement  polaritonic many-body methods to fully utilize modern heterogeneous (CPU/GPU) high-performance computing platforms at DOE’s LCFs.  
- **Objective 3:** Apply developed  methods to molecular polaritonic systems to validate, benchmark, and assess our developments with  reference systems, progressing to advanced applications to complement experiments to enhance fundamental understanding of polaritonic chemistry. 

### Team

- **Niranjan “Niri” Govind (Principal Investigator, PNNL)** is recognized for important contributions  to the development of linear and nonlinear spectroscopy methods based on real-time and linear-response  time-dependent density functional theory, X-ray spectroscopies, ultrafast dynamics, many-body methods,  embedding approaches, optimizers, orbital-free DFT, and applications to photoexcited molecular  complexes and materials. 
- **Karol Kowalski (co-PI, PNNL)** is an expert in advancing electronic structure methods and highly  scalable implementations of correlated many-body methods. He is recognized for important contributions  in CC theory including renormalized CC theories, multireference formulations, equation-of-motion linear response CC methods, and CC Green’s function formulations.  
- **Jonathan Foley (co-PI, University of North Carolina, Charlotte)** brings expertise in multiscale theory and modeling of light–matter  interactions and nanophotonics phenomena. He has developed novel theoretical methodologies combining  ab initio quantum chemistry with non-Hermitian cavity QED models leading to predictive theories for  polaritonic chemistry with explicit inclusion of photonic loss.  
- **Xiaosong Li (co-PI, University of Washington, Seattle)** is well known for his contributions to the  development of time-dependent electronic structure theory, relativistic many-body methods, and quantum dynamics. Li is also recognized for his important work in high-performance scientific software engineering,  numerical eigensolvers, and high-performance optimizers.
