# Many-Body Methods, Spectroscopies, and Dynamics for Molecular Polaritonic Systems (MAPOL)

## Overview

Our vision is to (1) develop a suite of theoretical frameworks, spanning low-order to high-level many-body  methods, that will provide unprecedented ability to capture the structure and dynamics of molecular  polaritonic systems, (2) deliver scalable software source code and libraries that can harness leadership-class  computational facilities (LCFs), and (3) nurture a community of practitioners in computational molecular  sciences. In pursuit of this vision, we propose three project objectives to guide our research program. 

- **Objective 1:** Polaritonic Many-Body Theories. Develop a Gaussian basis set–based suite of methods  spanning low-order to high-level ab initio many-body approaches for modeling and simulation of molecular  polaritonic systems.  
- **Objective 2:** High-Performance Computing and Automatic Differentiation Libraries. Implement  polaritonic many-body methods to fully utilize modern heterogeneous (CPU/GPU) high-performance  computing platforms at DOE’s LCFs and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center.  
- **Objective 3:** New Insights into the Physics and Chemistry of Molecular Polaritons. Apply developed  methods to molecular polaritonic systems to validate, benchmark, and assess our developments with  reference systems, progressing to advanced applications to complement experiments to enhance  fundamental understanding of polaritonic chemistry.
