## Many-Body Methods, Spectroscopies, and Dynamics for Molecular Polaritonic Systems (MAPOL)

Light when nanoconfined in cavities and made to interact strongly with molecules results in hybrid light–matter states or polaritons, which can be used to modify and manipulate ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces and thus alter the reactivity and energy flow profoundly in molecular systems.The development of predictive theories for molecular polaritons requires combining electronic degrees of freedom, as provided by quantum chemistry methods, with quantum electrodynamics (QED) treatments of the photonic degrees of freedom.

Our vision is to develop a suite of theoretical frameworks, spanning low-order to high-level many-body  methods, that will provide unprecedented ability to capture the structure and dynamics of molecular polaritonic systems and deliver scalable software source code and libraries that can harness leadership-class computational facilities (LCFs). In pursuit of this vision, we have three project objectives to guide our research program, which was initiated in September 2022.

- **Objective 1:** Develop a Gaussian basis set–based suite of methods  spanning low-order to high-level ab initio many-body approaches for modeling and simulation of molecular  polaritonic systems.  
- **Objective 2:** Implement  polaritonic many-body methods to fully utilize modern heterogeneous (CPU/GPU) high-performance computing platforms at DOE’s LCFs.  
- **Objective 3:** Apply developed methods to molecular polaritonic systems to validate, benchmark, and assess our developments with  reference systems, progressing to advanced applications to complement experiments to enhance fundamental understanding of polaritonic chemistry.
