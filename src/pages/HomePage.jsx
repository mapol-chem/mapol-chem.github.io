              Light when nanoconfined in cavities and made to interact strongly
              with molecules results in hybrid light–matter states or
              polaritons, which can be used to modify and manipulate ground and
              excited-state potential energy surfaces and thus alter the
              reactivity and energy flow profoundly in molecular systems.The
              development of predictive theories for molecular polaritons
              requires combining electronic degrees of freedom, as provided by
              quantum chemistry methods, with quantum electrodynamics (QED)
              treatments of the photonic degrees of freedom.

              Our vision is to develop a suite of theoretical frameworks,
              spanning low-order to high-level many-body methods, that will
              provide unprecedented ability to capture the structure and
              dynamics of molecular polaritonic systems and deliver scalable
              software source code and libraries that can harness
              leadership-class computational facilities (LCFs). In pursuit of
              this vision, we have three project objectives to guide our
              research program, which was initiated in September 2022.
